A comprehensive pipeline for creating and evaluating video question answering (VQA) datasets using agentic AI workflows. This repository implements an end-to-end system for curating real-world videos, generating multi-task VQA annotations, and evaluating vision-language models on diverse scenarios.

## Overview

SONIC-O1 provides a systematic approach to building high-quality VQA datasets across 13+ real-world topics including healthcare consultations, job interviews, emergency scenarios, and more. The pipeline generates three types of VQA tasks (via state-of-the-art LLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4):

- **Task 1 — Summarization:** Short + detailed summaries with temporal timelines
- **Task 2 — Multiple Choice (MCQ):** Questions with plausible distractors
- **Task 3 — Temporal Localization:** Finding specific moments in videos

## Pipeline Architecture

The system is organized into 5 stages:

```text
01_data_curation → 02_caption_generation → 03_demographics_annotation → 04_vqa_generation → 05_evaluation_inference
````

Each stage is self-contained with its own configuration, scripts, and documentation.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the **pipeline code only**. The dataset and annotations are available separately on Hugging Face (see links at top).

**Important:** After cloning, you'll have a nested structure: `sonic-o1/sonic-o1/`

* First `sonic-o1/` — the git repository root
* Second `sonic-o1/` — the working directory containing all pipeline code

```text
sonic-o1/                          # Git repository root
└── sonic-o1/                      # Working directory (cd here to run commands)
    ├── 01_data_curation/          # YouTube video collection and filtering
    ├── 02_caption_generation/     # WhisperX-based transcription
    ├── 03_demographics_annotation/# Character demographics extraction
    ├── 04_vqa_generation/         # Multi-task VQA generation
    ├── 05_evaluation_inference/   # Model evaluation framework
    ├── dataset/                   # Downloaded from HuggingFace
    └── vqa/                       # Downloaded from HuggingFace
```

**Not included in this repo (download from Hugging Face):**

* `dataset/` — curated videos, audio, captions, and metadata
* `vqa/` — generated VQA annotations (3 tasks × topics)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* GPU with CUDA support (recommended for caption generation and inference)
* API keys/tokens (only for the stages you plan to run):

  * YouTube Data API v3 (Stage 01; only if collecting new videos)
  * Google Gemini API / OpenAI API (Stages 03–05 depending on backend)
  * Hugging Face token (Stage 05 model downloads)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VectorInstitute/sonic-o1.git

# Navigate to working directory (note the nested structure)
cd sonic-o1/sonic-o1

# (Recommended) Download dataset + VQA annotations from Hugging Face
pip install huggingface_hub
huggingface-cli download vector-institute/sonic-o1 --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install base dependencies
pip install -r requirements_venv.txt
# Or using pyproject.toml:
pip install -e .

# Note: Each stage (01-05) may have additional dependencies.
# Stage 05 has model-specific requirements in 05_evaluation_inference/models_requirements/
```

### Environment Setup (API Keys)

Create a `.env` file in each stage directory **only if you plan to run that stage**:

```bash
# 01_data_curation/.env (only if collecting new videos)
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key

# 03_demographics_annotation/.env (only if annotating new videos)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# 04_vqa_generation/.env (only if generating new VQA tasks)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# 05_evaluation_inference/.env (for model evaluation)
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key  # if using Gemini models
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key  # if using OpenAI models
```

**Note:** If you're only evaluating models using the pre-curated dataset, you typically only need Stage 05.

## Dataset Download

Before running the pipeline, download the pre-curated dataset from Hugging Face:

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
huggingface-cli download vector-institute/sonic-o1 --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./
```

The download includes:

* `dataset/videos/` (topic-organized video files)
* `dataset/audios/` (extracted audio)
* `dataset/captions/` (WhisperX transcriptions)
* per-topic metadata JSON files
* `vqa/` directory (task annotations)

**Important:** Keep the directory names `dataset/` and `vqa/` exactly as downloaded.

## Pipeline Stages (what to run)

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

1. Disk quota exceeded: set cache directories to scratch space (see `02_caption_generation/README.md`)
2. API rate limits: adjust `rate_limit_delay` in configs
3. CUDA OOM: use smaller models or reduce batch sizes
4. Missing dependencies: check individual stage README files
5. Dataset path issues: ensure you're in `sonic-o1/sonic-o1` after cloning

## Support

* Open an issue on GitHub: [https://github.com/VectorInstitute/sonic-o1/issues](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/sonic-o1/issues)
* Check individual stage README files for detailed troubleshooting
* Review stage-specific configuration examples in `config/` directories
